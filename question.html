            <p class="fqa"><b>What varieties of potatoes do you offer on your website?</b></p>
            <p class="answer"><i>We offer a big variety of potatoes on our website.<br> Our most popular products are
                    the classic potato
                    which we offer in different sizes from big to small… <br> We also offer the classic potato in two
                    different shapes, oval and round for a more customised experience.<br>
                    Other than that you can find sweet potatoes from big to small sizes as well as oval and round shaped
                    sweet potatoes.<br>
                    Something unique with our potatoes is that the ethnicity of the potatoes are up to you. You can
                    choose to buy potatoes from over 190+ countries and we guarantee the same freshness.<br>
                </i></p>
            <br>
            <p class="fqa"><b>Are certain potato varieties only available during specific seasons?</b></p>
            <p class="answer"><i>While we try to always offer all types of potatoes under a certain season that can be
                    challenging.<br>
                    Throughout the year our potato varieties are always available. <br>However if something would come
                    up
                    and the availability of a potato would change we inform our customers as soon as possible.<br>
                    We also try to keep our website updated everyday to inform about product quantity and other
                    important information.<br>

            <p class="fqa"><b>What is the minimum and maximum quantity of potatoes that customers can order?</b></p>
            <p class="answer"><i>The <b>maximum</b> amount of potatoes you can order on our website is 50 kilograms.<br>
                    The <b>minimum</b> amount is one potato.<br>
                    However if you wish for an amount of potatoes that exceed the maximum and/or the minimum amount then
                    we
                    recommend <a class="click" href="contactus.html">contacting us</a>.<br>
                    Usually for special requests we ship more or less quantities of potatoes than available on our

                    No matter where you are you will have access to the full Spudly page and will be able to order
                    everything we offer.<br>

            <p class="fqa"><b>Do you have any quality guarantee or return policy?</b></p>
            <p class="answer"><i>We always guarantee 100% satisfaction amongst our customers. Since you can customise
                    the
                    potato it's guaranteed that you will get exactly what you wished for.<br>
                    While we always try to guarantee 100% customer satisfaction it's hard to always give the exact same
                    size
                    or shape everytime.<br>
                    However we do guarantee that the potatoes are not rotten or have any type of unwanted spots.<br>
                    You can also return our products for up to one week after receiving the items. Just contact us at
                    our
                    "<a class="click" href="contactus.html">contact us</a>" page and write your complaint and we will
                    send

            <p class="fqa"><b>Are there any discounts or promotions available for bulk purchases?</b></p>
            <p class="answer"><i>Sometimes we offer special discounts around holidays and other types of events.<br>
                    This is mainly because we know that potatoes are a crucial part of the holiday table.<br>
                    For bigger bulk purchases we do offer a small discount. <br>If it's a company or school buying our
                    potatoes we give a promotion mainly because of the amount of potatoes.<br>
                    We also offer to do a contract with companies that wish to buy our products regularly. In those
                    contracts the price is determined by the amount of potatoes per month and negotiation about the
                    price. <br>
                </i></p>
            <p class="fqa"><b>Can customers view the prices of potatoes per unit or weight on the website?</b></p>
            <p class="answer"><i>Since the minimum amount of potatoes on our website is one potato the price varies
                    depending on unit and weight.<br>
                    If you buy one potato the price will depend on the unit. However, there are options to buy 0.5kg all
                    the way to 50kg. Then the price will be determined by the weight.<br>
