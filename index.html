            <p class="insptext">Potatoes, with their humble roots, teach us that even in simplicity, one can find
                boundless potential for nourishment, resilience, and the ability to transform into something truly
                extraordinary.

                <h2 class="name underrubrik">About our potatoes</h2>
                <p class="chunkytext">
                    Our potatoes are truly organically made. From the dirt all the way to the table we put love into our
                    potatoes…<br>
                    <br>
                    Since we plant the seeds into the organic soil we make sure that the potatoes grow into something
                    beautiful that will bring a smile to your face.<br>
                    <br>
                    Our workers work hard everyday so the potatoes grow under natural circumstances with no added
                    chemicals. These workers have been trained to take care of potatoes so they grow into the best
                    version a potato can be.<br>
                    <br>
                    We offer a variety of potatoes from 190 different countries all in different sizes and shapes so you
                    can find the best potato just for you.<br>
                    <br>
                    We also offer sweet potatoes, and already cooked and fried potatoes, all for an affordable
                    price.<br>
                    <br>
                    Importing a large amount of potatoes from 190 different countries can be harsh on the environment…
                    That's why the Spudly team has decided to choose the best shipping option so we restrain our carbon
                    dioxide emissions as much as possible while preserving the quality of the potato.<br>
                    <br>
                    Our potatoes are delicious, crispy, fresh, and just the perfect potato for any family. We also keep
                    our prices low because <b>no one!</b> Should settle for worse potatoes than they deserve….<br>
                    <br>
                    If you don't know what to make from your delicious potatoes from Spudly we recommend checking out

                    <br>
                    At Spudly we don't waste potatoes, we believe that every potato deserves a chance to be eaten… That
                    is why under our <a class="click" href="allproducts.html">product list</a> you will find an option
                    where you can save potatoes from
                    getting their dreams crushed and never experience being made into delicious food.<br>
                    <br>
                    There you can buy imperfect potatoes for a reduced price… but remember <i>imperfection is
                        perfection!</i><br>

                <h2 class="name underrubrik">About us</h2>
                <p class="chunkytext">
                    We are a small team of one person… who are really passionate about potatoes and strive to always
                    give the best quality to our consumers.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ever since 2023 Spudly has been putting the best potatoes at the tables of thousands of
                    families.<br>
                    Our passion has always been food and cooking. That's why after finding rotten potatoes amongst the
                    store bought ones we decided to take matters into our own hands. We created Spudly so consumers
                    would never run into this problem, since rotten potatoes are no potatoes.<br>
                    <br>
                    Something else that bothered us at Spudly was the lack of potatoes at local supermarkets.
                    <br>
                    Currently our webbshop is the only one offering to sell potatoes from over 190 different
                    countries.<br>
                    This gives consumers the choice to choose <i>where</i> the potatoes come from and what <i>type</i>
                    of potatoes you
                    personally would like on your kitchen table.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Spudly team is currently a small team, but that doesn't stop us from doing big things.<br>
                    <br>
                    Ever since a young age potatoes have been our biggest interest. How come cooked potatoes taste so
                    different every time you cook them? Years of our lives we have dedicated to finding the perfect
                    potatoes and when we did we had to share it with the world…<br>
                    <br>
                    But soon we realised the potato that might be perfect for us might not be so perfect for someone
                    else… a potato from Belgium might taste better to someone than a potato from Japan… yet no one
                    preferred a half rotten potato over a perfectly cultivated potato.<br>
                    <br>
                    Our website is developed for easy navigation so you will find your favourite potato fast and easy.
                    Here you will find potatoes from different countries, shapes and sizes so you will find the perfect
                    potato just for you…
